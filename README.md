# Training program description:

The training team at the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core provides bioinformatics training through both shorter workshops and longer in-depth courses. Our current workshops and courses are designed to help biologists become comfortable with using tools to analyse high-throughput data. We are slowly beginning to expand this repertoire to include training for researchers with more advanced bioinformatics skills.

*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*

### Workshops

**Introduction to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis**: The goal of these workshops (2-3 days) are to enable researchers to design their NGS studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses.

| Topic | Link to Materials | Workshop Duration |
:----------:|:----------:|:----------:|
| Introduction to R and ggplot2 | [https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R/]() | 2 Days |
| Introduction to RNA-seq data analysis using High-Performance Computing| [https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-O2/]() | 3 Days |
| Introduction to R and Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis | [https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-with-DGE/]() | 3 Days |
| Introduction to Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis | [https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop/]() | 1.5 days |
| Introduction to ChIP-seq using High-Performance Computing | *In development* | 3 Days |
| Identifying variants in genome/exome sequencing data | *In development* | 2 - 3 Days |

  
**Current topics in bioinformatics**: These short workshops (half-day or less) are designed to allow researchers, who have some familiarity with R or bash, to learn new tools and methods. Only a subset of the short workshops topics are listed and linked below, for the full list please [click here](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/).

  * [Introduction to R & Visualizations with ggplot2](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/IntroR_ggplot2/)
  
  * [Plotting and visualization in R using ggplot2 and other packages](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Visualization_in_R/) *(Prereq: familiarity with R)*
  
  * [Introduction to shell/bash](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Intro_shell/)
  
  * [Intermediate shell/bash](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Intermediate_shell/) *(Prereq: familiarity with shell/bash*) 
    
### In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Course

[This intensive course](https://hbctraining.github.io/In-depth-NGS-Data-Analysis-Course/) runs for between **8 to 12 days** and is aimed at bench biologists interested in learning how to **independently** perform NGS data analyses using *best practices*. Topics include:

  * High-performance computing
  * Best practice workflows for NGS data analysis (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Variant calling)
  * R for statistical analysis and data visualization
  * Functional analysis with gene lists
  * Additional skils and tools for better reproducibility like reports with RMarkdown, version control with Git/Github, etc.
