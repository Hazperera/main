# Workshops offered by the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core (Spring 2019)

We would like to announce the launch of HBC's new training program for 2019!

This semester *we are piloting a new learning model* that replaces the 3-day workshops we have previously offered. While all of the content will remain the same as past workshops, we are changing the format to be ***more modular***. 

We have divided our training content into two categories: 

* **[Basic Data Skills](#basic-data-skills)** - No prior programming knowledge needed (no prerequisites)
* **[Advanced Topics: Analysis of high-throughput sequencing (NGS) data](#advanced-topics-analysis-of-high-throughput-sequencing-ngs-data)** - One or more "Basic" workshops required as prerequisites.

| Topic | Category | Date | Duration | Prerequisites |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: | :----: |
| **Introduction to the command line interface (Shell, Unix, Linux)** | Basic | January 17th | 1 day | None |
| **Introduction to R** | Basic | January 28th & 29th | 1.5 days | None |
| **Introduction to the command line interface (Shell, Unix, Linux)** | Basic | Early February | 1 day | None |
| **Introduction to (bulk) RNA-seq using High-Performance Computing** | Advanced | Late February | 2 days | Beginner Shell |
| **Introduction to R** | Basic | Early March | 1.5 days | None |
| **Introduction to Differential Gene Expression Analysis** | Advanced | Late March | 2 days | Beginner R |
| **Introduction to the command line interface (Shell, Unix, Linux)** | Basic | Early April | 1 day | None |
| **Introduction to ChIP-seq Analysis** | Advanced | Late April | 2 days | Beginner R + Shell |

## Basic Data Skills

These are short 1-1.5 day workshops that provide an introduction to computational skills required for one to get started with independent analyses. There are no prerequisites and prior experience or programming is *not* required. There are two topics that will alternate in the schedule with at least one offering a month. **The completion of one or more of these workshops is required in order to register for the Advanced Workshops.**

### Introduction to Shell 

This 1-day hands-on workshop participants will learn basic commands for navigating the file system, exploring file contents, and performing basic operations, such as moving, copying, and renaming files/folders. In addition, participants will get an introduction to high-performance computing (HPC).

### Introduction to R
This 2-day workshop will introduce participants to the basics of using R, a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support.

Participants will learn how to use R for:
* exploring basic data structures
* inspecting and wrangling data
* installing & working with data analysis packages
* making publication-quality plots with the ggplot2 package


## Advanced Topics: Analysis of high-throughput sequencing (NGS) data

These are 2 day intensive workshops that instruct participants on how to efficiently manage and analyze data, with a focus
on the workflow for a specific type of next-generation sequencing data (i.e RNA-seq, ChIP-seq). **These workshops require participants to have taken one or more of the Basic Data Skills workshops as listed in the table below.** 

| Topic | Duration | Pre requisites |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| **Introduction to (bulk) RNA-seq using High-Performance Computing** | 2 days | Beginner Shell |
| **Introduction to Differential Gene Expression Analysis**  | 2 days | Beginner R |
| **Introduction to ChIP-seq Analysis** | 2 days | Beginner R and Beginner Shell |
| **Introduction to single cell RNA-seq Analysis** | 2 days | Beginner R and Beginner Shell |


### RNA-seq Analysis

### Differential Gene Expression Analysis

### ChIP-seq analysis

### Single cell RNA-seq
