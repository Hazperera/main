# Training program description:

The training team at the Harvard Chan Bioinformatics Core provides bioinformatics training through both shorter workshops and longer in-depth courses. Our current workshops and courses are designed to help biologists become comfortable with using tools to analyse high-throughput data. We are slowly beginning to expand this repertoire to include training for researchers with more advanced bioinformatics skills.

*No prior NGS or command line expertise is required for our workshops or courses unless explicitly stated.*

### Workshops

**Introduction to Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) analysis**: The goal of these workshops (2-3 days) are to enable researchers to design their NGS studies appropriately and perform preliminary data analyses.

  * [Introduction to R and ggplot2](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R/README.html) (2 days)
  * [Introduction to RNA-seq data analysis using High-Performance Computing](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-rnaseq-hpc-O2/README.html) (2 or 3 days)
  * [Introduction to R and Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis](https://hbctraining.github.io/Intro-to-R-with-DGE/README.html) (3 days)
  * [Introduction to Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis](https://hbctraining.github.io/DGE_workshop/) (1.5 days)
  * Introduction to ChIP-seq using High-Performance Computing (3 days) *(In development)*

**Current topics in bioinformatics**: These short workshops (half-day or less) are designed to allow researchers, who have some familiarity with R or bash, to learn new tools and methods. 

  * [Introduction to R & Visualizations with ggplot2](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/IntroR_ggplot2/README.html)
  * [Plotting and visualization in R using ggplot2 and other packages](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Visualization_in_R/README.html) *(Prereq: familiarity with R)*
  * [Functional analysis of gene lists](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/DGE-functional-analysis/README.html) *(Prereq: familiarity with R)*
  * [Reproducible research using R: Report generation using Rmarkdown](https://hbctraining.github.io/Training-modules/Rmarkdown/README.html) *(Prereq: familiarity with R)*
  * Differential Gene Expression (DGE) analysis with DESeq2 (*Prereq: familiarity with R*) *(In development)*
  * Identifying variants in genome/exome sequencing data (*Prereq: familiarity with HPC and bash*) *(In development)*

### In-Depth Next Generation Sequencing Analysis Course

[This intensive course](https://hbctraining.github.io/In-depth-NGS-Data-Analysis-Course/) runs for between **8 to 12 days** and is aimed at bench biologists interested in learning how to **independently** perform NGS data analyses using *best practices*. Topics include:

  * High-performance computing
  * Best practice workflows for NGS data analysis (RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, Variant calling)
  * R for statistical analysis and data visualization
  * Functional analysis with gene lists
