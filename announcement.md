We would like to announce the launch of HBC's new training program for 2019!

This year we are piloting a new learning model that replaces the 3-day workshops we have previously offered. While all of the content will remain the same as past workshops, we are changing the format to be more modular. Our current content has been separated into two categories: 1) Basic Data Skills and 2) Advanced NGS Analyses. Each of these are described in more detail below.


## Basic Data Skills

These are short 1-1.5 day workshops that provide an introduction to computational skills required for one to get started with independent analyses. There are no prerequisites and prior experience or programming is *not* required. There are two topics that will alternate in the schedule with at least one offering a month. **The completion of one or more of these workshops is required in order to register for the Advanced Workshops.**

### Introduction to Shell 

This 1-day hands-on workshop participants will learn basic commands for navigating the file system, exploring file contents, and performing basic operations, such as moving, copying, and renaming files/folders. In addition, participants will get an introduction to high-performance computing (HPC).

### Introduction to R
This 2-day workshop will introduce participants to the basics of using R, a simple programming environment that enables the effective handling of data, while providing excellent graphical support.

Participants will learn how to use R for:
* exploring basic data structures
* inspecting and wrangling data
* installing & working with data analysis packages
* making publication-quality plots with the ggplot2 package


## Advanced NGS Analyses 

These are 2 day intensive workshops that instruct participants on how to efficiently manage and analyze data, with a focus
on the workflow for a specific type of next-generation sequencing data (i.e RNA-seq, ChIP-seq). **These workshops require participants to have taken one or more of the Basic Data Skills workshops as listed in the table below.** 

| Topic | Duration | Pre requisites |
| :----: | :----: | :----: |
| **Introduction to (bulk) RNA-seq using High-Performance Computing** | 2 days | Beginner Shell |
| **Introduction to Differential Gene Expression Analysis**  | 2 days | Beginner R |
| **Introduction to ChIP-seq Analysis** | 2 days | Beginner R and Beginner Shell |
| **Introduction to single cell RNA-seq Analysis** | 2 days | Beginner R and Beginner Shell |
